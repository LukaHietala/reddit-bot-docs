# Getting the packages in place


## Windows

For this part, we will head over to the folder where all the files are stored. Once you are there, you should see a bar at the top showing the directory's path. Double click that:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1).png>)

Once you double click it, type `cmd` and click enter. You should see a Command Prompt window pop up that is placed inside your source folder.&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Once in, type: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Word to word! Again, make sure you are in the directory. Give it a few minutes and let it download the packages. \
Once done, you should be seeing something like this:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
