# Downloading the Bot

To download the bot, and also view the source code, you need to download it from the GitHub page of Lewis Menelaws.

Start by visiting this [link](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot). Once you are there, you should see an option saying **code.**

Once you click it, you should see three options:

```

Using the github cli:

```bash

or by **downloading the zip**
