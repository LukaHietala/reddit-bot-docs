# Downloading the Bot

To download the bot, and also view the source code, you need to download it from the GitHub page of Lewis Menelaws.

Start by visiting this [link](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot). Once you are there, you should see an option saying **code.**

Once you click it, you should see three options:

You can either **Clone the repo**:

Using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot.git
```

Using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot
```

There will be a new Directory in your current working directory called ```RedditVideoMakerBot```

Use **Github Desktop**

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" width="300" heigth="300" alt="GD">

The repo will appear in your GitHub desktop app.

or by **downloading the zip**

The download should start (on Firefox and similar you may need to confirm the download) and the files should be placed in your preferred location.

Once done, unzip the files.
