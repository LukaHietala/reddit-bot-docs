# Final Words

If you still face any issues, try reinstalling Python and the source files and perform everything mentioned here once again. If after that you face issues, then look into the trubleshooting page, or in the panic section in the file (if there is one). If even after that you still continue to face issues, raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/issues) or get onto the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5uw4eCQf6Z) and ask the community for some help

With that being said, have fun with the bot.
