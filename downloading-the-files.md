# Downloading the Files

To download the files, and view the source code, we can visit the GitHub page of Lewis Menelaws.

To begin downloading the files, visit this [link](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot). Once you are there, you should see an option saying: _Code_.

Once you click it, you should see a _Download ZIP_ option, as seen in the screenshot. You can also clone it if you know what you're doing.

Once you click that, you should select your download location for the files or check your downloads folder**.**

Once done, unzip the files.
