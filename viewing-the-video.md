# Viewing the video

Notice that you have a new folder called `Results` in your source files?

<a href="https://imgur.com/UZY7Ame"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZY7Ame.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Open that folder, Once there, the video that the bot has just made for you should have the title that that goes with it ie:`What is something that gets all the hate that it deservers`? (This apply's as of update 2.2.2), that is your final video. **Please do not delete any clips/videos, the bot automatically deletes them when you run it again and replaces them with the new ones**.
