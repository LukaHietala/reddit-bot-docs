# Viewing the video

Notice that you have a new folder called `Results` in your source files?

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

Open that folder, Once there, the video that the bot has just made for you should have the title that goes with it ie: `What is something that gets all the hate that it deserves`? (This applies as of update 2.2.2), that is your final video. **Please do not delete any clips/videos, the bot automatically deletes them when you run it again and replaces them with the new ones**.
