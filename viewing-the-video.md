# Viewing the video

If you want to watch a video in a clean ui, than in GUI there is a index.html file. Double click it and it will bring you to a nice clean ui that will help view videos. If you want to publish them to platforms like tiktok or youtube shorts, than in the project folder there is a new `Results` folder. This is where you can get the final mp4 video

Open that folder, Once there, the video that the bot has just made for you should have the title that goes with it ie: `What is something that gets all the hate that it deserves`? (This applies as of update 2.3).

**Please do not delete any clips/videos, the bot automatically deletes them when you run it again and replaces them with the new ones**.
