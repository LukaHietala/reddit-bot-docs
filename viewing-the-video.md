# Viewing the video

Notice that you have a new folder called `assets` in your source files?

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

Open that folder, you should see a video called `final_video.mp4` (could be a different name if updated), that is your final video. **Please do not delete any clips/videos, the bot automatically deletes them when you run it again and replaces them with the new ones**.
