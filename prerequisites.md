# Prerequisites

### Requirements:

* [ ] Python, version 3.6+. To install Python, visit the official [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or check the Microsoft Store and install the latest version.
* [ ] Node.js: install the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will see two options, _LTS_ and _Current_, you can pick _LTS_ which means that the version will be supported longer.

### Some things you need to make sure:

While installing Python, you will see a checkbox at the bottom which says _Add Python 3.10.x to PATH_. **Make sure you check this box, it is extremely crucial!**

Once you have installed Python and Node.js, launch a command prompt window (preferably as an administrator) and type `pip`, if you see something like this, you have done the Python installation correctly:

Just to double-check your python version, type `python --version` on your command prompt. You should get something like this (the version can be different):

Lastly, type `node` on your terminal to make sure Node.js is installed correctly. You should see something like this:

Voila! You are done. :thumbsup:
