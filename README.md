# The Reddit Bot?

We have all seen those Text To Speech videos on YouTube and TikTok, right? Well, those low effort videos can be completely automated now! Using this Reddit Bot, you can produce a high quality video that is TikTok and YouTube ready in less than 5 (to 10) minutes with almost no effort.

All the credit for this bot's development goes to Lewis Menelaws. Get in touch with Lewis and his server filled with a bunch of lovely developers [here](https://discord.gg/5uw4eCQf6Z). To check out the project on github (and maybe leave a star on it), [click here](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot).

This simple documentation will guide you through the installation process of the bot & its required source files and get you running in no time!

Psst. We need your help! If you feel that the documentation is incomplete or want to contribute to it  here's the link. [https://github.com/LukaHietala/reddit-bot-docs](https://github.com/LukaHietala/reddit-bot-docs)
