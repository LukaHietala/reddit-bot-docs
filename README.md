# The Reddit Bot?

We have all seen those Text To Speech videos on YouTube and TikTok, right? A minecraft background,screenshots from a random reddit thread, and TTS. Well, those low effort videos can be completely automated now! Using this Bot, you can produce a high quality video that is TikTok and YouTube ready in less than 5 (to 10) minutes with almost no effort.

Before we start tough there is an installation script that installs everything from scratch. If you are on MacOS or Linux i would strongly reccomend you use that:

`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/master/install.sh)`

All the credit for this bot's development goes to Lewis Menelaws. Get in touch with Lewis and his server filled with a bunch of lovely developers [here](https://discord.gg/5uw4eCQf6Z). To check out the project on github (and maybe leave a star on it), [click here](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot).

This simple documentation will guide you through the installation process of the bot & its required source files and get you running in no time!
